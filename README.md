# Cathedral / QGG Hybrid Demo

This is a sealed, all-inclusive demo of the Quantum Gate Grid (QGG) anomaly detection engine. It runs instantly in any Python environment (including Termux), requires no external files, and produces a full empirical report from inline data.

## 🔧 Features

- Inline dataset — no CSV required
- Survey: drift, spread, count
- Stealth: anomaly score, jitter
- Propulsion: trend vector, stability
- Plasma: electron density, temperature hint
- Ionization: rare event propensity
- Audit: SHA256 vault + ED-style seal
- Outreach: timestamped demo packet

## 🚀 Run

```bash
python qgg_hybrid_demo.py 🛡️ Quantum Gate Grid (QGG) — Baseline Framework

This repo contains the **baseline-only logic** for the Quantum Gate Grid anomaly detection system.  
Full uplift modules, sealed overlays, and verified replay logic are gated behind contract.

---

## 🔧 Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_baseline.py
# Cathedral + QGG Unified Pipeline

Cathedral seals the manifest first. QGG runs cycles second.  
One continuous artifact: narratable, reproducible, sealed.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && ./run_all.sh
